# Rust Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1: Variables and Data Types
Create a program that:
1. Declares variables of different types (int, float, bool, char)
2. Uses both mutable and immutable variables
3. Demonstrates variable shadowing

**File to create**: `exercises/ex1_variables.rs`

## Exercise 2: Functions
Create a program with functions that:
1. Calculate the area of a rectangle
2. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
3. Check if a number is even or odd (return bool)

**File to create**: `exercises/ex2_functions.rs`

## Exercise 3: Control Flow
Create a program that:
1. Uses if/else statements
2. Implements a for loop to print numbers 1-10
3. Uses a while loop to count down from 5

**File to create**: `exercises/ex3_control_flow.rs`

## Exercise 4: Ownership (Most Important!)
Create a program that demonstrates:
1. Move semantics
2. Borrowing with references
3. Mutable references

**File to create**: `exercises/ex4_ownership.rs`

## Exercise 5: Structs and Enums
Create a program with:
1. A `Person` struct with name, age, and email
2. An enum for different types of pets
3. Methods on the struct

**File to create**: `exercises/ex5_structs_enums.rs`

## Exercise 6: Error Handling
Create a program that:
1. Uses `Result<T, E>` for error handling
2. Uses `Option<T>` for nullable values
3. Handles parsing errors gracefully

**File to create**: `exercises/ex6_error_handling.rs`

## Exercise 7: Collections
Create a program that:
1. Uses Vec<T> to store a list of numbers
2. Uses HashMap to store key-value pairs
3. Iterates over collections

**File to create**: `exercises/ex7_collections.rs`

## Project Ideas (After completing exercises)

### Beginner Projects
1. **Calculator CLI** - Basic arithmetic operations
2. **Todo List** - Add, remove, list tasks
3. **Password Generator** - Generate secure passwords
4. **File Reader** - Read and count words in a file
5. **Temperature Converter** - Convert between C, F, K

### Intermediate Projects
1. **JSON Parser** - Parse and manipulate JSON data
2. **Web Scraper** - Extract data from websites
3. **Chat Client** - Simple TCP chat application
4. **Game** - Tic-tac-toe or simple text adventure
5. **CLI Tool** - File organizer or log analyzer

## Tips for Learning Rust

1. **Embrace the compiler errors** - Rust's compiler is very helpful!
2. **Start small** - Don't try to build complex apps immediately
3. **Read the error messages** - They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
4. **Use `cargo check`** - Faster than full compilation for error checking
5. **Practice ownership daily** - It's the hardest concept but most important

## Next Steps

1. Complete exercises 1-7 in order
2. Read "The Rust Programming Language" book chapters 1-10
3. Try the official Rust exercises: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
4. Pick a small project and build it
5. Join the Rust community: https://users.rust-lang.org/

Happy coding! ðŸ¦€
